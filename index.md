## About Me 

I am an associate professor of machine learning at the University of Calgary. Most of my recent work has been in unsupervised Machine Learning for functional data and Co-clustering. I am also interested in Time Series Forecasting and Robust methods. I have five years of industrial experience in different industries, such as insurance and education.

## Research Interests

- **Statistics:**  Functional Data Analysis, Time series Forecasting, Non-parametric statistics
- **Machine Learning:** Pattern recognition, Unsupervised Learning, Robust Machine Learning
